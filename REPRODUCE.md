# How to reproduce every headline number

**One command, standard library only:**

```bash
python3 reproduce.py
```

It prints, for each substrate, the paper value next to the value recomputed from the
bundled data, with `PASS`/`FAIL`, and exits non-zero if anything deviates. Expected:
`RESULT: all 33 numeric checks PASSED.`

Every number in the paper maps to a bundled file below. Where the raw dataset is large
or third-party, the **fit output** is bundled (so the headline is verifiable from this
folder) and the **raw source** is linked (so the fit itself can be re-run end-to-end).

## Notes on two values that are *deliberately* dual

- **Colorectal Δã.** The canonical headline is the **stage-aggregated** result (MSI 0.286 < MSS 0.439, Δ = −0.153): along the stage/load axis the mismatch-repair-deficient class yields earlier (pre-specified negative sign). Sorting the population by FGA or within-stage by mutation count gives Δ = +0.05/+0.09 — a counting-sort artefact, stored in `crc_results_v2.json → group_results`, **not** the headline. Both are kept so the artefact is transparent. `crc_stage_aggregated.json` holds the headline; `domain_crc_v2.py` (ANALYSIS 2) re-derives it.
- **Al-6061 ã.** `0.084` is the **median of the logistic inflection over the 146 valid fits** (`per_specimen_al6061.tsv`). The mean over all 154 specimens is `0.282` (heavy right skew); that mean is *not* the headline. `reproduce.py` recomputes the median.

## What is NOT recomputed stdlib-only

`reproduce.py` recomputes 33 numbers from the bundled data with the standard library.
The colorectal stage fit and the DP1180 KS test against the synthetic null require a
curve fit / null model (numpy+scipy); for those the bundled **result** is checked, and the
**raw data + script** are bundled (CRC) or linked (DP1180) so a reviewer with numpy/scipy
can re-run the fit. Every paper number is therefore either recomputed here or re-runnable
from a bundled/linked source — nothing rests on an unshipped value.
